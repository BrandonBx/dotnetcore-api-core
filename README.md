This is "tools box" and a pre-built api dotnet core with all common dependencies for developping a new **project**.  

Well Guys, this project is surely useless but at least you can use this example project without implementing swagger or registration and login. Almost all is already implemented even the JWT Token.

By the way, if you want to use Identity, just look for the documentation to microsoft.
If you also bring some improvements so don't hesitate to request a pull.
Don't forget to use command "dotnet restore" for restauring all dependencies.

ENJOY
